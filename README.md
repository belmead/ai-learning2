# 6-Month AI/ML Mastery Syllabus
*From AI Tool User to AI Solution Builder*

## Overview & Learning Philosophy

### 🔍 Learning Path Reflection
This plan is designed for a product designer evolving into an AI-capable solution builder. The projects align with different professional "personas" you can present at work:

- **Project 1: Echoparse (Weeks 1–8)** – Data-aware prompt engineer and integrator
- **Project 2: AI Data Visualization (Weeks 9–16)** – Storyteller with insight and ML interpreter
- **Project 3: Chatbot/Workflow Tool (Weeks 17–24)** – Solution builder with usability and task-focus

Each project should be demo-ready and explainable to both technical and business peers.

---

### 🧠 Learning Style Adjustments
- Low-math, visual intuition is prioritized until theory is necessary.
- Light, targeted theory primers will be inserted before each major project milestone.
- Teaching checkpoints ("Could I explain this?") encourage knowledge transfer and credibility building.



**Total Time Commitment:** 6-8 hours/week
- **Weekday Sessions:** 20-30 minutes (5 nights/week)
- **Weekend Deep Work:** 2-3 hours (coding projects, hands-on practice)
- **Commute Learning:** 50 minutes/day podcasts

**Three Major Projects:**
1. **Weeks 1-8:** Enhanced Echoparse (Advanced RAG + Better UX)
2. **Weeks 9-16:** Financial Data Visualization with AI Insights
3. **Weeks 17-24:** Domain-Specific Chatbot with Custom Training

### Week 1: Python Fundamentals & Your Current Stack
**Weeknight Goals (20-30 min each):**

**Monday: Python Basic Data Types & Syntax**
- **Resource:** Python.org tutorial section 3 (An Informal Introduction to Python)
- **Action:** Create `week1_basics.py` file with these exercises:
  - Create and print different data types:
    ```python
    # Numbers
    age = 25
    price = 19.99
    
    # Strings
    name = "John"
    message = 'Hello world'
    
    # Lists (use square brackets [])
    fruits = ["apple", "pear", "banana", "kiwi"]
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    # Dictionaries (use curly braces {})
    person = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
    
    # Print everything to see what they look like
    print(fruits)
    print(person["name"])
    ```
  - Practice accessing list items: `fruits[0]`, `fruits[-1]`
  - Practice accessing dictionary values: `person["age"]`
- **Run and test:** Make sure you can create, modify, and print each data type

**Tuesday: Map Your Echoparse Architecture**
- **Resource:** Your existing codebase + VS Code
- **Action:** Create `echoparse_map.md` file documenting:
  - What each main .py file does (1 sentence per file)
  - What external APIs you call (Google Play, Apple, your LLM API)
  - What data flows in and out (reviews → processed data → frontend)
  - Draw a simple text diagram of: User Request → Backend → APIs → Database → Frontend
- **Don't analyze every line** - just understand the big picture flow

**Wednesday: NumPy Fundamentals**
- **Resource:** NumPy Quickstart tutorial (numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
- **Action:** Create `numpy_practice.py` with:
  - Create arrays representing app ratings (1D and 2D arrays)
  - Calculate averages, find maximum/minimum ratings
  - Practice array slicing and boolean indexing
  - Understand why NumPy is faster than regular Python lists for math
- **Goal:** Understand vectors as lists of numbers that you can do math on quickly

**Thursday: Pandas Data Manipulation**
- **Resource:** Pandas "10 Minutes to pandas" (pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
- **Action:** Create `pandas_practice.py` with:
  - Load sample app review data into a DataFrame (create fake data if needed)
  - Practice filtering, sorting, and grouping operations
  - Calculate basic statistics (mean rating, review count by date)
  - Export to CSV and read it back
- **Goal:** Understand DataFrames as spreadsheets you can manipulate with code

**Friday: Virtual Environments Setup**
- **Resource:** Python venv documentation + Real Python tutorial
- **Action:** 
  1. Create new folder `ai_learning_projects`
  2. Run `python -m venv ai_env` inside it
  3. Activate environment: `source ai_env/bin/activate` (Linux) or `ai_env\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
  4. Install packages: `pip install numpy pandas jupyter`
  5. Create `requirements.txt` file with your installed packages
  6. Practice deactivating and reactivating the environment
- **Goal:** Never install Python packages globally again - always use virtual environments

**Weekend Project (2-3 hours):**

**Set up Development Environment:**
- Create GitHub repo called `ai-learning-journey` 
- Install Jupyter Lab: `pip install jupyterlab` in your new virtual environment
- Create folder structure:
  ```
  ai-learning-journey/
  ├── week01/
  ├── notebooks/
  └── README.md
  ```
- Test that you can run Jupyter Lab and create a new notebook (save for future weeks)

**Week 1 Python Assignment - `week1_assignment.py`:**
Create a simple app review analyzer that demonstrates everything you learned:
```python
# Create sample app review data
reviews = [
    {"rating": 5, "text": "Great app!", "date": "2024-01-01"},
    {"rating": 2, "text": "Too many bugs", "date": "2024-01-02"},
    {"rating": 4, "text": "Pretty good", "date": "2024-01-03"}
]

# Your tasks:
# 1. Calculate average rating using a for loop
# 2. Find all reviews with rating >= 4
# 3. Create a dictionary with rating counts (how many 1-star, 2-star, etc.)
# 4. Write a function that takes a review list and returns the highest rated review
# 5. Bonus: Extract all words from review texts into a single list
```

**Document Echoparse Architecture:**
