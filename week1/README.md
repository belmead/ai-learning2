# Week 1: Python Fundamentals & Environment Setup

## 🔍 Overview
This week focused on refreshing Python basics, understanding my current AI tool stack, and setting up a clean local development environment with virtual environments.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- Reviewed Python data types (int, float, str, list, dict)
- Documented Echoparse architecture
- Practiced with NumPy and Pandas
- Set up local virtual environment (`ai_venv`)
- Installed JupyterLab and verified notebook launch
- Created and committed `requirements.txt`

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Importance of virtual environments for reproducible Python setups
- Python collections behavior (e.g., list slicing, dict lookup)
- How JupyterLab fits into a data science workflow

## 📘 Reading Summary
- "Hands-On Machine Learning" Ch. 1, 2
- Reflection Questions:
  - What’s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
  - What steps are involved in a complete ML project pipeline?
  - What real-world problems map well to regression/classification?

## 📂 Project Files
- `week1/`
  - `notes/` – personal notes and scratch files
  - `notebooks/` – Jupyter experiments
  - `python_envs.md` – guide to virtual environment setup
  - `requirements.txt` – frozen environment packages

## 🧭 Next Steps
